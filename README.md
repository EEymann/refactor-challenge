#### _This short program demonstrates one possible way to refactor a long block of code by using a for loop. August 2020_

#### By _**Elizabeth Eymann**_

## Description

_This project comes from teamtreehouse.com. This short program is an example of one possible way to refactor a long block of code. The aim of the program is to use inner HTML to dynamically print to the screen ten consecutive numbers inside randomly changing colored circles using a random number generator to change the RGB color values. Before refactoring, you can see the same block of code repeated ten times. To make the program more concise, I used a for loop to loop through the block of code ten times. I used interpolation to change the numbers from 1 through 10, consecutively._
