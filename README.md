# _Refactor Challenge with a For Loop: Refactor again!_

#### _This short program is a continuation of refactoring on my previous "Refactor Challenge with a For Loop". August 2020_

#### By _**Elizabeth Eymann**_

## Description

_This project comes from teamtreehouse.com. This short program is an example of one possible way to refactor even further my previous "Refactor Challenge with a For Loop". The aim of the program is the same as the previous challenge: to use inner HTML to dynamically print to the screen ten consecutive numbers inside randomly changing colored circles using a random number generator to change the RGB color values. There are a few versions of refactoring within this repository, which have been documented with commits. The final version shows the RGB function with a parameter named 'value'. Value then replaces each randomValue function call three times inside the function randomRGB. Then, inside the for loop, randomValue is passed into the randomRGB function, which is printed to the screen ten times by looping through the loop, each time adding 1 to the variable i. Finally, the document.querySelector taps into 'main' using innerHTML, updating the HTML variable with the ten numbers and ten random color circles generated by the for loop. Phew!_
